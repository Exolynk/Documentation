## Introduction Model Templates

Model templates are pre definied Data models including a set of variables, a frontend layout, workflow and service code. Templates can be exported and imported as a *.json file.

### Template Upload

Model Templates can be found and downloaded on our template library or can be shared between exolynk clients directly.

>>>> Please be aware that in **released** models, either the model itself nor its variables can be deleted. New variables can be added or edited. If you added a wrong variable and released the model accidentally, no worries, just do not link it in the layout and it will be nowhere visible on the front-end side.
